## Descritption
This program retrieves uptime for the local and remote hosts and print in an easy to read format.
if a host has not been seen before, it is queried for it's platform type which is then
cached. This speeds up future lookups.

Hosts may be specified that are either in your ~/.ssh/config, /etc/hosts or are resolveable
via dns or zeroconf. If no host is specified the current host is queried.

Remote hosts are queried using SSH and you must have credentials set up for each host.
See ssh(1) for more information on ssh. If you can ssh to a host without a password, then
it can be queried with this tool.

Sorting: Sorting is done based on column names. The columns names are, in order of output:

        host, ip, machtype, uptime

Sorting is controlled via the -r and -s flags (See above)
